# Optimal_placement_of_EVCS

Electric Vehicles(EV) play a crucial role in advancing sustainable transportation and promoting a
cleaner, healthier, and more economically stable future. EVs are crucial in the future for several reasons
such as the reduction of green house gas emissions, improved driving experience and improving the
energy independence status of a country. The placement of electric vehicle charging stations(EVCS) is
an important factor in the adoption and integration of EVs into society. Charging stations should be
strategically placed to ensure coverage across a wider geographical area and to provide charging options
for long-distance travel. There are many factors that play a role in the strategic placement of EVCS,
including but not limited to power grid load, consumer demand, government subsidies and distance
between charging stations. In our project, we have incorporated some of these objectives in an
optimization model that shall be solved by some evolutionary computing tools. We have achieved each
of these objectives and we can infer the solution quality from the end result obtained. In future, We shall
also scale this to larger networks and observe the quality of solutions for a fixed computational running
time.

Here,In this Project our team has taken a region of 200*350 km.\n
